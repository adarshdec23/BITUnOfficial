                <h3>Who we are <b>:</b></h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="redText">We</span> are a group BIT students. Nothing more, nothing less.
                </p>
                <h3>Why did we create this website? <b>:</b></h3>
                <p>
                    Well, you've seen the actual BIT website. This compelled us into creating an alternative, which would be  student friendly and provide timely updates.
                </p>
                <h3>What ahead?</h3>
                <p>
                    We hope to keep this website up and running for as long as possible.<br>
                    Right now, our utmost concentration is on bringing correct, precise and on the dot updates to this
                    website.
                </p>
                <h3>Will the site design change?</h3>
                <p>
                    Change is almost always a desirable process. Similarly this website too may(and hopefully will) undergo timely changes.

                <p>
                    Since our purpose is to ensure that at least this website stays up to date with the latest 
                    happenings in the college, we would highly appreciate it if we could get timely inputs and
                    positive and constructive criticism from you. 
                    After all, this website was created for the benefit of all BITians.
                    So ensure that you <a href="contact.php">stay in touch</a> and we will do the same.
